# Insurance Loss Analytics Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **insurance claim losses**, which is critical for setting fair and competitive premiums in the insurance industry. Accurate prediction helps avoid **adverse selection** (overpricing low-risk customers and underpricing high-risk ones) and ensures a balanced, profitable portfolio.

Insurance claim data is highly skewed, with many policyholders reporting **zero claims**, making modeling challenging. Such data is often assumed to follow a **Tweedie distribution**, which can handle both claim frequency and severity.

We explore predictive modeling approaches (statistical and machine learning) to estimate:

1. **Loss Cost per Exposure Unit (LC)**
2. **Historically Adjusted Loss Cost (HALC)**
3. **Claim Status (CS: whether a claim occurs)**

---

## üìÇ Datasets

Two datasets are used:

* **insurance\_train.csv** ‚Üí Training dataset with 37,451 policy transactions
* **insurance\_test.csv** ‚Üí Test dataset with 15,787 policy transactions

Both datasets include variables **X.1 ‚Äì X.28**, though some are excluded from the test set (X.1, X.15, X.16, X.17, X.18).

## üßÆ Key Formulas

1. **Loss Cost per Exposure Unit (LC):**

$$
LC = \frac{X.15}{X.16}
$$

Where:

* `X.15` = Total cost of claims during the current year
* `X.16` = Total number of claims during the current year

---

2. **Historically Adjusted Loss Cost (HALC):**

$$
HALC = \frac{X.15}{X.16} \times X.18
$$

Where:

* `X.18` = Ratio of claims filed to total duration (years) of policy in force

---

3. **Claim Status (CS):**

$$
CS =
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if a claim occurs} \\ 
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
$$

## üéØ Project Tasks

1. **Task 1: Predict LC and HALC**

   * Build models to predict continuous insurance metrics: LC and HALC.
   * Evaluate models using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

2. **Task 2: Predict Claim Likelihood (CS)**

   * Binary classification problem.
   * Evaluate using **ROC-AUC**.
